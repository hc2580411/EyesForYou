# EyesForYou
## Overview
This project is a transformative initiative designed to empower blind and visually impaired individuals by combining real-time human assistance with advanced technological features. Through a shared camera experience and innovative tools, we aim to create a world where everyone, regardless of their visual abilities, can navigate life with confidence, independence, and safety.

## Features

### Real-Time Human Assistance
- Blind or visually impaired users can request help by sharing their camera feed with a volunteer.
- Volunteers provide immediate guidance, such as:
  - Reading text (e.g., menus, signs, or documents).
  - Identifying objects (e.g., products, hazards, or landmarks).
  - Assisting with navigation in unfamiliar environments.

### Smart AI-Powered Tools
To enhance independence, the platform integrates advanced AI-powered features:
- **Path Detection:** Identifies clear and safe walking paths, alerting users to obstacles or uneven terrain.
- **Traffic Light Recognition:** Detects and announces the status of traffic lights, helping users safely cross streets.
- **Object Identification:** Recognizes and describes objects in the environment, such as signs, doors, or hazards.

### Seamless Connection
- A secure and user-friendly interface ensures instant connection between users and volunteers.
- Designed with accessibility in mind, making it easy for blind and visually impaired individuals to use.

## How It Works
1. **User Requests Help:**  
   A blind or visually impaired user opens the app and shares their camera feed.
2. **Volunteer Connects:**  
   A volunteer joins the session and views the shared camera feed in real-time.
3. **Assistance Provided:**  
   The volunteer provides guidance or the AI tools offer automated support (e.g., path detection, traffic light recognition).
4. **Task Completed:**  
   The user gains the information or assistance they need to complete their task safely and independently.
